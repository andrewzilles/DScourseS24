\section{Tell me about some data sources that you would be interested in scraping from}
In a very practical sense, I would like to scrape information from company's 10-K or 10-Q filings. Last semester I was asked to come up with a research question and I thought it would be interesting to compare the disclosures from companies that face audit certainty with the IRS from those that do not. I don't expect there to be a major reporting difference between these companies but it would be an interesting result either way. In a less practical but more for fun sense, it would be cool to pull live MLB game data and show scores, hits, outs, etc.
