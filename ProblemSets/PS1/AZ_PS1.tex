\section{Introduction}
I'm interested in economics and data science partly out of necessity and partly out of self interest. The necessity is that it's a requirement for my PhD program. Without this class I wouldn't be able to graduate with that degree. I'm hoping that I can obtain useful skills from this class to help me perform research and code effectively. The self interest part is that I really am interested in learning these different coding languages and software. I can see how my nerdy friends caught the "coding bug" because it really can suck you in. I wouldn't label myself a nerd - yet. But it's definitely interesting! Oh there were more than that one question. Research ideas? I'll probably keep it simple and do a replication/extension of an already published accounting paper. My goal for this class is to gain enough knowledge to be dangerous but not necessarily lethal. After graduation I hope to find a job at a good research school and begin generating lots of unique accounting research so that I can get tenure somewhere.
